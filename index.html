            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> <span class="color-text"><b>Welcome to Food Network!</b></span> My name is Jeanine, and I created
                Food
                Network to celebrate how
                nourishing,
                fun, and delicious cooking with seasonal fruits and vegetables can be. I hope that the recipes here
                inspire
                you to try cooking a new vegetable, or try cooking a familiar vegetable in a new way. You’ll find a
                host
                of
                inventive vegetarian recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but I also want Food Network to be a
                resource
                for you. We have guides to working with vegetables ranging from spaghetti squash to asparagus and
                tips
                for
                cooking plant-based basics like quinoa, rice, and lentils.

                And after all those veggies, I always save room for dessert! In my opinion, healthy eating is all
                about
                balance, so you’ll find recipes for brownies, cakes, cookies, and more here too.</p>

            <p>While I love all the recipes that I post here on the blog, some of my all-time favorites are actually in
                my
                Food Network blog. Both best-selling books are packed with 100+ vegetarian recipes, gorgeous
                photography,
                and resources to help you become a home cooking pro!

            <h3>Bright Spring Salad</h3>
            <p>There’s nothing I crave more than this spring salad. Light,
                bright, and packed with spring’s best produce, it’s a perfect example of why eating seasonally is so
                exciting.</p>

            <h3>SPRING PASTA </h3>
            <p>We actually handmade these pasta noodles. Between messy flour,
                sticky noodles, and it being 11pm… we failed to get photographs of any part of that process.</p>

            <h3>SUMMER SALAD</h3>
            <p>This bean and corn salad is flavorful, refreshing, and great for making ahead. It's a crowd-pleasing
                cookout side dish or a perfect summer lunch.</p>
