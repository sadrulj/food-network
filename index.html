                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> <span class="color-text"><b>Welcome to Food Network!</b></span> My name is Jeanine, and I created
                    Food
                    Network to celebrate how
                    nourishing,
                    fun, and delicious cooking with seasonal fruits and vegetables can be. I hope that the recipes here
                    inspire
                    you to try cooking a new vegetable, or try cooking a familiar vegetable in a new way. You’ll find a
                    host
                    of
                    inventive vegetarian recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but I also want Food Network to be a
                    resource
                    for you. We have guides to working with vegetables ranging from spaghetti squash to asparagus and
                    tips
                    for
                    cooking plant-based basics like quinoa, rice, and lentils.

                    And after all those veggies, I always save room for dessert! In my opinion, healthy eating is all
                    about
                    balance, so you’ll find recipes for brownies, cakes, cookies, and more here too.</p>
